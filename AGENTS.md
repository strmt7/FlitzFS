# Agent instructions for autonomous FlitzFS development

## Non-negotiable safety constraints

The owner's highest-priority requirements are: **do not format or repartition drives; do not damage existing data; do not freeze the system; do not exhaust RAM, VRAM, CPU, or disk space.** Treat any unverified claim of safety as a blocker, not an invitation to take a risk. An isolated test is preferred to any risky test on the owner's Windows PC.

- Never run, suggest executing, or programmatically invoke raw-device writes, `diskpart`, `format`, `clean`, `Initialize-Disk`, `Clear-Disk`, partition changes, volume-level reconfiguration, or commands that alter boot/system state.
- Never install, load, or enable a filesystem/kernel driver on the user's PC automatically. Never auto-mount over an existing directory or drive letter. Mounting is a separate release gate and must begin with a disposable read-only fixture.
- Never overwrite, move, modify, truncate, delete, or recursively remove files outside a freshly created, uniquely scoped test fixture. Do not use `remove_all` in tests.
- Preserve source data unmodified. Require creation of a **new** output path and verify it does not already exist at the OS open/create operation, not merely with a prior existence check.
- Keep all builds/tests CPU-only by default. GPU experiments are opt-in and limited to synthetic data with tiny memory and short duration. Never stress-test WDDM or alter GPU clocks/power/voltage/driver settings.
- Do not run background services, scheduled tasks, persistence across reboot, Windows registry edits, or privileged operations on the user machine as part of an automatic task.
- Guard resource use with explicit hard caps, disk-space reserves, bounded queues, timeouts, and CPU fallback. If resource headroom cannot be determined, fail closed.
- Do not declare real-world data safety, full NTFS compatibility, Windows qualification, or HIP speed improvements from tests that did not evaluate those properties.

## Owner-controlled development state

The owner alone decides when to release. Do not add or bump product numbering,
create tags/releases, publish packages or call development commits releases.
Identify progress by implemented behavior, exact commit hashes and executed
checks. Preserve existing wire compatibility and historical evidence.

## Development workflow

1. Inspect current git history and user changes before editing; preserve existing repo content and licensing. Develop and commit directly to `main` only; do not create development branches or PRs. Never force-push.
2. Work in small, validated commits on `main`; mark all generated artifacts **experimental**. Use official documentation for WinFsp, Microsoft Windows I/O, AMD HIP/ROCm, Zstd and cryptographic dependencies.
3. Extend deterministic byte-for-byte tests and malicious-input rejection before adding new storage features.
4. Run CPU-only unit tests, raw-only build, ASan/UBSan where supported, and CI on both Windows and Linux. Do not substitute Linux success for Windows qualification.
5. Design filesystem changes with explicit rollback/recovery, correct flush durability, no data loss under kill/power failure, and an independent CPU reader.
6. Run any system-level or GPU tests only after the source is audited and the test harness enforces strict resource budgets and kill-switch behavior; never use primary disks or unique user data.
7. Update README, FORMAT, SAFETY, ROADMAP, and validation results with actual measured facts, not projected results.

## Present development boundary

The project has an **OFF-by-default native WinFsp read-only callback backend**
to the CPU `.flfs` container, synchronized catalog and Windows-path projection.
Read `docs/WINFSP_CALLBACKS.md` before touching it. Callback tests use synthetic
files and the user-mode SDK DLL only: no filesystem creation, mount, dispatcher,
driver installation, persistent service or GPU operation. The pinned SDK staging
script may run only on disposable GitHub-hosted Windows runners, never on the
owner's PC. A successful callback test is not a mounted-filesystem qualification.

Reader is single-threaded; catalogs lock each file. Native callbacks additionally
bound handles and concurrent decodes. Destruction/move must not race callbacks.
Encryption, authentication, HIP execution and writable volumes remain unimplemented.
FLZIP compatibility covers the pinned block kinds within a bounded CPU subset; consult `docs/FLZIP_READONLY.md`. Keep optional behavior opt-in and report
actual test coverage without upgrading partial tests into production claims.

## Explicit isolated integration exception

The optional hosted-CI-only mount probe is documented in `docs/LIVE_MOUNT_PROBE.md`.
Normal builds and CTest remain no-mount/no-driver. Only the separate
`windows-mount` job may provision the pinned driver on a disposable GitHub-hosted
Windows VM, after the ordinary CI gates pass. Never transfer that permission to
the owner's PC, a self-hosted runner, arbitrary files or an existing mountpoint.
The probe must keep its 128 MiB/20% CPU/30-second process limits and synthetic-only
input policy. Kernel faults cannot be covered by a no-freeze guarantee.

The bounded plaintext collection manifest and read-only CLI are described in
`docs/CATALOG_MANIFEST.md`. They do not implement encryption, authentication,
transactional writes, or hostile-directory sandboxing. Keep the existing
namespace and index budgets; validate all references before backing access.

The FLZIP snapshot reader must verify every file before exposure, never initialize
HIP, and reject unavailable codecs explicitly. Preserve its physical/index/
block/logical caps. The upstream serializer oracle is test-only, read-only and
commit-pinned; never edit other repositories or claim full CLI interoperability.

Native GPU-format decoding is CPU-only. Consult `docs/NATIVE_CODEC_PLAN.md` for
closed composition stages, one-block scratch and optional LZ4 semantics. Never
infer actual GPU execution from codec names. The test-only upstream decoder
extractor must verify the exact blob before selecting functions; do not weaken
that check or link the generated oracle into product targets.

## GPU preparation boundary

Read `docs/HIP_BATCH_PLAN.md` before changing the GPU batch, device kernel or
DXGI collector. The kernel is compiled offline only, never loaded automatically.
The default CLI and filesystem paths remain CPU-only. CPU semantic tests of the
shared device body must not be described as GPU execution. Keep 8-block/64-KiB/
256-KiB batch bounds, independent CPU comparison, fail-closed memory telemetry,
immutable owned input, one outstanding request and terminal failure semantics.
No actual-runtime integration or owner-device experiment is qualified yet.

## Worker transport boundary

Read `docs/WORKER_CHANNEL.md` before changing worker frames or process exchange.
Normal file operations still never launch a worker. The Windows fixture runs
only the same trusted test binary and CPU semantics. Do not call those results
GPU execution. Keep bounded memory-only frames, one exchange at a time, protected
local-session objects, successful confirmed child exit before reply copying,
independent reference comparison, and no automatic runtime retries.
